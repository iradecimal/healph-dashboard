# healph-dashboard

This project was developed as a requirement for CMSC190 - Special Problem, entitled "HEALPH-DASH: A DATA VISUALIZATION DASHBOARD
FOR DIETARY MONITORING OF UPLB STUDENTS"

A live deployment of this project is available on: 
(https://healph-dashboard.vercel.app/)

The deployment runs on data gathered from the HEAL-PH Data test, which is somewhat erroneous. As such, some of the charts may be displaying no data.
